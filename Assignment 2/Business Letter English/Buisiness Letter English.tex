	\end{center}
	Dear Dr. Fazli,}

\begin{flushleft}
I would like to apply for the teaching assistant position in the "Game Theory" course. I have a passion for helping in the teaching process of this subject to the students.

I have taken the course in the fall 2022 semester and had been in the teaching team of the same course instructed by Dr. Nilipour last semester and had helped with the homework. I could utilize my experience from the previous semester to enrich this course.

Thank you for your consideration. I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future for the course details.



Yours Sincerely,
